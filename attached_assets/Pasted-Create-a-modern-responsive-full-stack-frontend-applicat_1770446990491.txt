Create a modern, responsive full-stack frontend application using React (with Vite or Create React App), Tailwind CSS, and React Router for the Subscription Management System (multi-tenant subscription marketplace).

Project Goal – 40% frontend focus:
This is the frontend part of a hackathon project (around 40% of total work).
The backend will be Node/Express + PostgreSQL + Prisma (handled separately).
The app has THREE distinct portals with role-based access:

1. Admin Portal (for company admins – e.g. Netflix Admin, AWS Admin, Google Admin)
2. Internal Portal (for internal reviewers – multiple available)
3. User Portal (for end customers / subscribers)

Multi-tenant Marketplace Flow:
- Company Admin creates products and assigns them to one available Internal person
- Internal person adds subscription plans and publishes the product
- Published products appear in the User Portal for subscription
- Only Admin can choose which Internal gets the product (constraint)

Core Features to implement:

Authentication & Routing
- Login / Signup page (email + password)
- Strong password validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, special char)
- Unique email check (mocked for now)
- Role-based routing: /admin, /internal, /user
- Protected routes using context or simple auth state (JWT token in localStorage for demo)

Shared Components
- Clean sidebar navigation (different menu items per role)
- Responsive layout (mobile-first, Tailwind)
- Dark mode toggle (optional but nice)
- Loading spinner + error toast messages
- Consistent color scheme (blue-gray modern theme)

1. Admin Portal (/admin/*)
- Dashboard: Welcome message + quick stats (my products count, total revenue mock)
- Products page:
  - List of my products (table or cards)
  - Create Product button → form: name, type, sales price, cost price, variants (add multiple: attribute, value, extra price)
  - For each product: "Assign to Internal" button → dropdown of available internals (mock list of 3-4 names)
  - After assign → show status "Assigned to [Name]"
- Reports page: simple cards (active subscriptions, total revenue, overdue count) – mock data

2. Internal Portal (/internal/*)
- Dashboard: List of products assigned to me
- For each assigned product:
  - View details
  - Form to add Recurring Plan: name, price, billing period (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), min quantity, start/end date, options (pausable, renewable, closable, auto-close)
  - "Publish to Users" button → changes product status to published
- Invoices & Payments tab: list of invoices for published subscriptions (mock data)

3. User Portal (/user/*)
- Home / Browse Products: grid of published products (show company name/logo if available, name, price, plan period)
- Product Detail page:
  - Show product info, available plans
  - "Subscribe" button → simple form (select plan, quantity)
  - Mock success → show "Subscription created"
- My Subscriptions page:
  - List of my subscriptions (number, plan, start date, expiration, status)
  - Status badge (Active / Overdue / Paused)
- Invoices page:
  - List of invoices (number, date, amount, status)
  - Detail view: show lines, taxes, total, "Pay Now" button (mock)
- Profile: show email, basic settings (mock)

Technical Requirements:
- Use React + React Router v6
- Use Tailwind CSS (include via CDN or install)
- Use Axios for API calls (mock responses with useEffect + setTimeout for now)
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for form validation
- Use react-hot-toast for notifications
- Use lucide-react or heroicons for icons
- Mock data structure (JSON objects) for products, plans, subscriptions, invoices
- Later I will replace mocks with real API calls
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Nice UI touches: hover effects, status badges (green/active, red/overdue), loading states

Folder Structure Suggestion:

  │   ├── Login.jsx
  │   ├── AdminDashboard.jsx

Start by:
1. Setting up project with Vite + React + Tailwind
2. Implementing Auth + routing with role-based access
3. Creating the three portals with sidebar navigation
4. Building Admin product creation + assignment flow
5. Building Internal plan creation + publish flow
6. Building User product browsing + subscription flow

Generate the complete starting codebase with mock data so I can see all three portals working.
